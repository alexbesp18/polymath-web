# Autopilot Session Log

## Session 2026-01-04 19:30

### North Star Reference
MVP COMPLETE → Polish & Harden (from docs/plan.md)

### Work Completed
- Created .context.md, docs/plan.md, docs/checkpoint.md
- Established project documentation structure

### Decisions Made (Without Asking)
- Created standard doc structure despite no /doclikealex run: Project already built, need to document current state

### Next Actions (For Resume)
1. Initialize git repo
2. Fix domain data (180 vs 170 issue)
3. Add CLI integration tests
4. Test pm-log end-to-end

### Drift Checks
- 19:30: Aligned - Setting up context before executing P0 tasks
