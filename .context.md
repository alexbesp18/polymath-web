## State
[status: ACTIVE]
Supabase + web migration complete. CLI (51 tests) + Web (Vercel) both deployed and working.

## Decisions
- 2026-01-04: FunctionSlot returns string not enum → Simpler, avoids .value everywhere
- 2026-01-04: Config.create_default() for init → Handles chicken-and-egg config problem
- 2026-01-04: 180 domains (not 170) → Accurate count across 15 branches
- 2026-01-04: branch_id int vs str fix → BRANCHES uses int, vault code was comparing to str
- 2026-01-05: Supabase as primary backend → Enables web app, dual-mode vault preserves Obsidian sync
- 2026-01-05: Next.js 16 + App Router → Modern React with Server Components
- 2026-01-05: Custom schema `polymath` → Isolates from other projects in same Supabase instance
