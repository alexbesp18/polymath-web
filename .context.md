## State
[status: YOURS]
MVP hardened, 51 tests passing, git repo initialized. Ready for real-world testing.

## Decisions
- 2026-01-04: FunctionSlot returns string not enum → Simpler, avoids .value everywhere
- 2026-01-04: Config.create_default() for init → Handles chicken-and-egg config problem
- 2026-01-04: 180 domains (not 170) → Accurate count across 15 branches
- 2026-01-04: branch_id int vs str fix → BRANCHES uses int, vault code was comparing to str
