## State
[status: CLAUDES]
MVP complete, all CLI commands working, 35 tests passing. Ready for polish/hardening.

## Decisions
- 2026-01-04: FunctionSlot returns string not enum → Simpler, avoids .value everywhere
- 2026-01-04: Config.create_default() for init → Handles chicken-and-egg config problem
- 2026-01-04: 180 domains created (not 170) → Some duplicate/unknown entries in data

## Open Loops
- [ ] Clean up duplicate/unknown domain entries in data (created: 2026-01-04)
- [ ] Add CLI integration tests (created: 2026-01-04)
- [ ] Initialize git repo (created: 2026-01-04)
- [ ] Verify pm-log command works end-to-end (created: 2026-01-04)
- [x] All 6 MVP CLI commands implemented (closed: 2026-01-04)
- [x] All unit tests passing (closed: 2026-01-04)
